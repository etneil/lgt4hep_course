# lgt4hep_course

Collection of course materials to be used for the lattice-QCD training course as part of the [LGT4HEP](https://lgt4hep.github.io) traineeship.

## From path integrals to QCD: overview of continuum theory (2 weeks)


## From scalar to gauge theories, on the lattice (3 weeks)


## Fermion actions and chiral fermions (2 weeks)


## Renormalization (2 weeks)

### Suggested lecture topics

1. Overview; renormalization in continuum QFT
2. Lattice renormalization and scale setting
	- Why is scale setting necessary?
	- What observables are commonly used to fix the lattice spacing?
	- What observables are commonly used to fix quark masses?
3. Perturbative matching and alpha_S
4. Non-perturbative renormalization
